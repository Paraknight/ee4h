## Project Style Guide ##

For consistency, the first time something is done in a particular style becomes the project standard.

- Indentation - Tabs
- Brackets - No spaces before or after. No space before commas.
- Braces - New line, e.g.:
```
void getX()
{
    return x;
}
```

## Project Git Conventions ##

- The master branch must always be stable. Only merge with the master branch if all code works. Branch to work on features or bug fixes.
- Prefix dev branches with group names. See [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273695/git-branch-naming-best-practices) for examples.
